#### FAQ:
+ **Forge or Fabric?** This mod is for fabric.
+ **Will there be a Forge Version?** No. I don't think I'll ever start modding for Forge again.
+ **Client or Server?** It is possible for Vanilla clients to join a server with this mod, they will see all patterns on a banner, could lead to some weirdness. -> Needs to be on both for it to work.
+ **Modpack?** You can use it in any modpack, credit me if possible.
+ **Is this mod compatible with x?** I don't know, haven't tested it. I will add a list of incompatible mods if any problems come to my attention.
